# This test runner passes a list of every 4th test file into 4 simultaneous
# mocha processes so it can use 4 cores efficiently. This should run no faster
# than 4 times faster than series. In practice, it runs about twice as fast on
# a 4 core machine. You must execute this from the project root directory. You
# must have "parallel" installed for this to work. On Ubuntu: "apt-get install
# parallel".
